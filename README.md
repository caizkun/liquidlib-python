# liquidlib-python

A reconstructed, mini-skeleton of [LiquidLib](http://zhang-group.github.io/LiquidLib/) written in Python


This project is one of my attempts to apply design patterns to some problems we have worked on before. I am pretty sure there are still a few places that can be improved. The code may not be that *Pythonic* as we may need to rewrite the C++ version if it works. So the code is more like a demo.

If you are interested, please fork it and help me improve the design.  


**Design patterns applied**:
* Simple factory
* Strategy
* Decorator
