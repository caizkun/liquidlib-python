# liquidlib-python

A reconstructed, mini-skeleton of [LiquidLib](http://zhang-group.github.io/LiquidLib/) written in Python


This project is motivated by my eagerness to to practice and apply design patterns to some problems we have work on before. I am pretty sure there are still a few places that can be improved.

If you are interested, please fork it and help me improve the design.


Design patterns used:
* Simple factory
* Strategy
* Decorator
